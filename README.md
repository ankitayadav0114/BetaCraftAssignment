E2E Playwright Automation Framework
This project contains a comprehensive end-to-end (E2E) test suite for the SauceDemo web application, built with the Playwright test automation framework. The tests are designed to validate key user flows and ensure the application's stability.

ðŸŒŸ Features
Page Object Model (POM): The framework uses a POM design pattern for better code organization, reusability, and maintainability. * End-to-End Test Scenarios: A full "happy path" test case that simulates a user's journey from login to order completion.

Edge Case Testing: An "invalid password" test to verify error handling and a negative test case.

Data-Driven Testing: Test data is separated into a userData.json file, making it easy to manage and update.

Built-in Assertions: Utilizes Playwright's robust expect library for reliable assertions.

Prerequisites
Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
Git: Git is required to clone the repository.
